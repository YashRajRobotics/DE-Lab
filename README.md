4 bit ALU Protius file (requires Protius software)

This project focusses on showing how a 4-bit ALU works. An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that 
performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates 
on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing 
unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain multiple ALUs.

The inputs to an ALU are the data to be operated on, called operands, and a code indicating the operation to be performed; the ALU's 
output is the result of the performed operation. In many designs, the ALU also has status inputs or outputs, or both, which convey 
information about a previous operation or the current operation, respectively, between the ALU and external status registers.
